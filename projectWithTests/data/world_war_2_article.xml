'''World War&nbsp;II''' (often abbreviated to '''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), also known as the '''Second World War''', was a [[World war|global war]] that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved [[World War II by country|the vast majority of the world's countries]]—including all of the [[great power]]s—eventually forming two opposing [[military alliance]]s: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of "[[total war]]", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including [[the Holocaust]] (in which approximately 11 million people were killed){{sfn|Fitzgerald|2011|p=4}}{{sfn|Hedgepeth|Saidel|2010|p=16}} and the [[strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing of industrial and population centres]] (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]),<ref>{{cite book |title=War, Violence, and Population: Making the Body Count |author=James A.

These made World War&nbsp;II the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in [[History of the world|human history]].{{sfn|Sommerville|2008|loc=p. 5 (2011 ed.)}}

The [[Empire of Japan]] aimed to dominate [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and was already [[Second Sino-Japanese War|at war]] with the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] in 1937,{{sfn|Barrett|Shyu|2001|p=6}} but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939<ref>Axelrod, Alan (2007) ''Encyclopedia of World War II, Volume 1''. Infobase Publishing. pp. 659.</ref> with the [[invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|Supplied by the Soviet   Union]], from late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], with campaigns including the [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]] campaigns, the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz bombing campaign]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] as well as the long-running [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|largest land theatre of war in history]], which trapped the major part of the Axis' military forces into a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States]] and [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific.

The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]], near [[Hawaii]], and Germany was defeated in [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Allied invasion of Italy]] which brought about Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South]] [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.

The war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany]] by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops and the subsequent [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the [[Soviet–Japanese War (1945)|Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan]] and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] on 15 August 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies.

World War&nbsp;II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious [[great power]]s—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref name="The UN Security Council">{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the [[Cold War]], which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers waned, while the [[decolonisation of Asia]] and [[decolonisation of Africa|Africa]] began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post–World War II economic expansion|economic recovery]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity.<ref>{{cite web|title=From War to Peace: A European Tale|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-lecture_en.html|publisher=Nobel Lecture by the European Union|accessdate=4 January 2014|author=Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council|author2=José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission|date=10 December 2012}}</ref>

Rowman & Littlefield Publishing. pp. 7.</ref> beginning with the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]]; Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later.

Others follow the British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]], who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and the two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other starting dates sometimes used for World War&nbsp;II include the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Abyssinia]] on 3 October 1935.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Horin|1943|p=169}}; {{Harvnb|Taylor|1979|p=124}}; Yisreelit, Hevrah Mizrahit (1965).

The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the [[armistice]] of 14 August 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945). A [[Treaty of San Francisco|peace treaty with Japan]] was signed in 1951 to formally tie up any loose ends such as compensation to be paid to Allied prisoners of war who had been victims of atrocities.{{sfn|Masaya|1990|p=4}} [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|A treaty regarding Germany's future]] allowed the [[German reunification|reunification of East and West Germany]] to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of German-American Relations » 1989–1994 – Reunification » "Two-plus-Four-Treaty": Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, September 12, 1990|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm|publisher=usa.usembassy.de|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>

==Background==
{{Main article|Causes of World War II}}

===Europe===
[[World War I]] had radically altered the [[Geopolitics|political]] European map, with the defeat of the [[Central Powers]]—including [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—and the 1917 [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|seizure of power]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]], which eventually led to the founding of the [[Soviet Union]]. Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Romania, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.

To prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, Völkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]

Despite strong [[pacifism|pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&pg=PA76 76–8]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory and all of [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}

The German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a "[[New Roman Empire]]".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10541, Weimar, Aufmarsch der Nationalsozialisten.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Weimar]], October 1930]]

Adolf Hitler, after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually became the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Chancellor of Germany in 1933]]. He abolished democracy, espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].{{sfn|Brody|1999|p=4}} It was at this time that political scientists began to predict that a second Great War might take place.{{sfn|Dawood|Mitra|2012}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco-Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced [[conscription]].{{sfn|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}

To contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]] in April 1935; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.</ref> The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}

Hitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising]] the [[Rhineland]] in March 1936, encountering little opposition.{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome–Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy would join in the following year.

===Asia===
The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in China launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against [[Warlord Era|regional warlords]] and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese Communist Party]] allies.{{sfn|Preston|1998|p=104}} In 1931, an [[Militarism-Socialism in Showa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Japanese Empire]], which had long sought influence in China{{sfn|Myers|Peattie|1987|p=458}} as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|launch an invasion of Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Smith|Steadman|2004|p=28}}

Too weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Coogan|1993}}: "Although some Chinese troops in the Northeast managed to retreat south, others were trapped by the advancing Japanese Army and were faced with the choice of resistance in defiance of orders, or surrender. A few commanders submitted, receiving high office in the puppet government, but others took up arms against the invader. The forces they commanded were the first of the volunteer armies."</ref> After the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]], the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a [[Second United Front|united front]] to oppose Japan.{{sfn|Busky|2002|p=10}}

===Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)===
{{Main article|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}

[[File:Soldatietiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Italian soldiers recruited in 1935, on their way to fight the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]]]

The Second Italo–Abyssinian War was a brief [[colonial war]] that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Names of Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]) by the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia''), which was launched from [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia |author1=Andrea L. Stanton |author2=Edward Ramsamy |author3=Peter J. Seybolt |page=308 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}</ref> The war resulted in the [[military occupation]] of Ethiopia and its [[annexation]] into the newly created colony of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI); in addition, it exposed the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated the League's [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations|Article X]].{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=131–2}} Germany was the only major European nation to support the invasion. Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]].{{sfn|Kitson|2001|p=231}}

===Spanish Civil War (1936–39)===
{{Main article|Spanish Civil War}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|The [[bombing of Guernica]] in 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], sparked Europe-wide fears that the next war would be based on bombing of cities with very high civilian casualties]]

When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist rebels]], led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. Over 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the [[International Brigades]], also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the USSR used this [[proxy war]] as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics.  The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, bargained with both sides during the Second World War, but never concluded any major agreements. He did send [[Blue Division|volunteers]] to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] under German command but Spain remained neutral and did not allow either side to use its territory.{{sfn|Payne|2008}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

===Japanese invasion of China (1937)===
{{Main article|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[File:Shanghai1937IJA ruins.jpg|thumb|left|[[Japanese Imperial Army]] soldiers during the [[Battle of Shanghai]], 1937]]

In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Beijing after instigating the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.{{sfn|Eastman|1986|pp=547–51}} The Soviets quickly signed a [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact with China]] to lend [[materiel]] support, effectively ending China's prior [[Sino-German cooperation 1926–1941|co-operation with Germany]]. [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] deployed his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|best army]] to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]], but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, [[Battle of Nanking|capturing the capital Nanking]] in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were [[Nanking Massacre|murdered by the Japanese]].<ref>Levene, Mark and Roberts, Penny. ''The Massacre in History''. 1999, page 223-4</ref><ref name=tot>Totten, Samuel. ''Dictionary of Genocide''. 2008, 298–9.</ref>

In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their [[Battle of Taierzhuang|first major victory at Taierzhuang]] but then the city of [[Xuzhou]] [[Battle of Xuzhou|was taken by Japanese]] in May.{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|pp=221–230}} In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by [[1938 Yellow River flood|flooding the Yellow River]]; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at [[Wuhan]], but the [[Battle of Wuhan|city was taken]] by October.{{sfn|Eastman|1986|p=566}} Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to [[Chongqing]] and continued the war.{{sfn|Taylor|2009|pp=150–2}}{{sfn|Sella|1983|pp=651–87}}

In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in [[Manchukuo]] had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Japanese doctrine of [[Hokushin-ron]], which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkin Gol]] in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=342}} and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of [[Nanshin-ron]], promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.<ref>{{cite web |author=Goldman, Stuart D. |date=28 August 2012 |title=The Forgotten Soviet-Japanese War of 1939 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |publisher=The Diplomat |url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Timothy Neeno |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War |publisher=MilitaryHistoryOnline.com |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/nomonhan.aspx}}</ref>

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], again provoking [[Appeasement of Hitler|little response]] from other European powers.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2000|p=144}} Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the [[Sudetenland]], an area of [[Czechoslovakia]] with a predominantly [[ethnic German]] population; and soon Britain and France followed the counsel of British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and conceded this territory to Germany in the [[Munich Agreement]], which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=121–2}} Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to [[First Vienna Award|cede additional territory]] to [[Hungary]] and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's [[Zaolzie]] region.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=157}}

Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 [[Plan Z|secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy]] to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia]] and subsequently split it into the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and a pro-German [[client state]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]].{{sfn|Davies|2006|loc=pp. 143–4 (2008 ed.)}} Hitler also delivered [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|an ultimatum]] to Lithuania, forcing the concession of the [[Klaipėda Region]].

Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the [[Free City of Danzig]], Britain and France [[Anglo-Polish military alliance#British Guarantee to Poland|guaranteed their support for Polish independence]]; when [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy conquered Albania]] in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to Romania and [[Greece]].{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=330}} Shortly after the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance|Franco]]-British pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the [[Pact of Steel]].{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2001|p=234}} Hitler accused Britain and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and renounced the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] and the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]].

In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]],{{sfn|Shore|2003|p=108}} a non-aggression treaty with a secret protocol. The parties gave each other rights to "spheres of influence" (western [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] for Germany; [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|eastern Poland]], Finland, [[Estonia]], Latvia and [[Bessarabia]] for the USSR). It also raised the question of continuing Polish independence.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2001|p=608}} The agreement was crucial to Hitler because it assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I, after it defeated Poland.

The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. In a private meeting with the Italian foreign minister, [[Count Ciano]], Hitler asserted that Poland was a "doubtful neutral" that needed to either yield to his demands or be "liquidated" to prevent it from drawing off German troops in the future "unavoidable" war with the Western democracies. He did not believe Britain or France would intervene in the conflict.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/1871-ps.asp Minutes of the conference between the Fuehrer and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Count Ciano, in the presence of the Reich Foreign Minister of Obersalzberg on 12 August 1939] in Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression Volume IV

On 6 October Hitler made a public peace overture to Britain and France, but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union.

Throughout this period, the neutral United States took measures to assist China and the Western Allies. In November 1939, the American [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] was amended to allow [[Cash and carry (World War II)|"cash and carry"]] purchases by the Allies.{{sfn|Overy|Wheatcroft|1999|pp=328–30}} In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the [[United States Navy]] was [[Two-Ocean Navy Act|significantly increased]]. In September, the United States further agreed to a [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement|trade of American destroyers for British bases]].{{sfn|Maingot|1994|p=52}} Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention into the conflict well into 1941.{{sfn|Cantril|1940|p=390}}

Although Roosevelt had promised to keep the United States out of the war, he nevertheless took concrete steps to prepare for war. In December 1940 he accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an "[[Arsenal of Democracy|arsenal of democracy]]" and promoted the passage of [[Lend-Lease]] aid to support the British war effort.{{r|ibiblio_1940}} In January 1941 secret high level staff talks with the British began for the purposes of determining how to defeat Germany should the US enter the war. They decided on a number of offensive policies, including an air offensive, the "early elimination" of Italy, raids, support of resistance groups, and the capture of positions to launch an offensive against Germany.<ref>{{cite web |author=Skinner Watson, Mark |title=Coordination With Britain |website=US Army in WWII – Chief of Staff: Prewar Plans and Operations |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Plans/USA-WD-Plans-12.html}}</ref>

At the end of September 1940, the [[Tripartite Pact]] united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the [[Axis Powers]]. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.{{Sfn|Bilhartz|Elliott|2007|p=179}} The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and [[Romania]] joined the Tripartite Pact.{{Sfn|Dear|Foot|2001|p=877}} Romania would make a [[Romania in World War II|major contribution]] (as [[Hungary in World War II|did Hungary]]) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|territory ceded to the USSR]], partially to pursue its leader [[Ion Antonescu]]'s desire to combat communism.{{Sfn|Dear|Foot|2001|pp=745–6}}

Italy began operations in the Mediterranean, initiating a [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|siege of Malta]] in June, [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|conquering British Somaliland]] in August, and [[Italian invasion of Egypt|making an incursion into British-held Egypt]] in September 1940. In October 1940, Italy started the [[Greco-Italian War]] because of Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but within days was repulsed and pushed back into Albania, where a stalemate soon occurred.{{sfn|Clogg|2002|p=118}} The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece. Hitler decided that when the weather improved he would take action against Greece to assist the Italians and prevent the British from gaining a foothold in the Balkans, to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to secure his hold on Romanian oil.<ref>{{Harvnb|Evans|2008|pp=146, 152}}; {{Harvnb|US Army|1986|pp=[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_1.htm 4–6]}}</ref>

In December 1940, British Commonwealth forces began counter-offensives against [[Operation Compass|Italian forces in Egypt]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)#Allied counter-offensive|Italian East Africa]].{{sfn|Jowett|2001|pp=9–10}} The offensive in North Africa was highly successful and by early February 1941 Italy had lost control of eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by a [[Battle of Taranto|carrier attack at Taranto]], and neutralising several more warships at the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]].{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=106}}

[[File:E 003743 E.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Afrika Korps]] soldiers, December 1941]]
The Germans soon intervened to assist Italy. Hitler [[Operation Sonnenblume|sent German forces to Libya]] in February, and by the end of March they had [[Axis desert offensive (1941)|launched an offensive]] which drove back the Commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support Greece.{{sfn|Laurier|2001|pp=7–8}} In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the [[Siege of Tobruk|besieged port of Tobruk]].{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|pp=263–7}} The Commonwealth [[Operation Brevity|attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May]] and [[Operation Battleaxe|again in June]], but failed on both occasions.{{sfn|Macksey|1997|pp=61–3}}

By late March 1941, following [[Bulgaria]]'s signing of the [[Tripartite Pact]], the Germans were in position to intervene in Greece. Plans were changed, however, because of developments in neighbouring [[Yugoslavia]]. The Yugoslav government had signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March, only to be overthrown two days later by a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|British-encouraged coup]]. Hitler viewed the new regime as hostile and immediately decided to eliminate it. On 6 April Germany simultaneously invaded both [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Greece|Greece]], making rapid progress and forcing both nations to surrender within the month. The British were driven from the Balkans after Germany [[Battle of Crete|conquered the Greek island of Crete]] by the end of May.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=229}} <!-- REFERENCE SEEMS VERY NARROW FOR RANGE OF EVENTS COVERED --> Although the Axis victory was swift, bitter partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the [[Axis occupation of Yugoslavia]], which continued until the end of the war.

The Allies did have some successes during this time. In the Middle East, Commonwealth forces first [[Anglo-Iraqi War|quashed an uprising in Iraq]] which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]],{{sfn|Watson|2003|p=80}} then, with the assistance of the [[Free French]], [[Syria–Lebanon Campaign|invaded Syria and Lebanon]] to prevent further such occurrences.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=154}}

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in [[Southeast Asia]], the two powers signed the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941.{{sfn|Garver|1988|p=114}} By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=195}}

Hitler believed that Britain's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-3.html 69]}} He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, [[German–Soviet Axis talks|negotiations took place]] to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.

===War breaks out in the Pacific (1941)===
{{main|Pacific War}}
In 1939, the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan; and, beginning with an [[aviation gasoline]] ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure.{{r|ibiblio_1940}} During this time, Japan launched its [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|first attack against Changsha]], a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September.{{sfn|Jowett|Andrew|2002|p=14}} Despite [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|several offensives]] by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940.

German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in [[Southeast Asia]]. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan some oil supplies from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.<ref>{{cite web |title=Japanese Policy and Strategy 1931 – July 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=45–66 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-2.html}}</ref> In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East.

Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war, as [[Imperial Japanese Army|IJA]] General [[Hideki Tojo]] became Imperial Japan's Prime Minister on 17 October. On 20 November it presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange they promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw their forces from their threatening positions in southern Indochina.{{r|USAWWIIcp5}} The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/congress/app-d.html#363 The United States Replies].

Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=310}}; {{Harvnb|Dower|1986|p=5}}, calls attention to the fact that "the Allied struggle against Japan exposed the racist underpinnings of the European and American colonial structure.

Dower goes on to note that, before the horrors of Japanese occupation made themselves felt, many Asians responded favourably to the victories of the Imperial Japanese forces.</ref> To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.{{sfn|Wood|2007|pp=11–2}} On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous [[Japanese expansion (1941–1942)|offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific]].{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–3}} These included an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor]], [[Military history of the Philippines during World War II|the Philippines]], [[Battle of Malaya|landings in Thailand and Malaya]]{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–3}} and the [[battle of Hong Kong]].

===Axis advance stalls (1942–43)===
[[File:Casablanca-Conference.jpg|thumb|right|Seated at the [[Casablanca Conference]]; US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British PM [[Winston Churchill]], January 1943]]

In January 1942, [[Big Four (World War II)|the Allied Big Four]]{{sfn|Bosworth|Maiolo|2015|pp=313–314}} (the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and China) and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the [[Declaration by United Nations]], thereby affirming the [[Atlantic Charter]],{{sfn|Mingst|Karns|2007|p=22}} and agreeing to not to sign a [[separate peace]] with the Axis powers.

During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate [[grand strategy]] to pursue. All agreed that [[Europe first|defeating Germany]] was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, [[Operation Sledgehammer|large-scale attack]] on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.<ref>{{cite web |title=The First Full Dress Debate over Strategic Deployment.

By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]], [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Rabaul]], inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=247–267, 345}} Despite stubborn [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|resistance]] by Filipino and US forces, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.{{sfn|Lewis|1953|loc=p. 529 (Table 11)}} On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=71–4}} Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|South China Sea]], [[Battle of the Java Sea|Java Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean]],{{sfn|Grove|1995|p=362}} and [[Bombing of Darwin|bombed the Allied naval base]] at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|victory at Changsha]].{{sfn|Ch'i|1992|p=158}} These easy victories over unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.{{sfn|Perez|1998|p=145}}

In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to [[Operation Mo|capture Port Moresby]] by [[amphibious assault]] and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].{{sfn|Maddox|1992|pp=111–2}} Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier [[Doolittle Raid]], was to seize [[Midway Atoll]] and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|occupy the Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska.{{sfn|Salecker|2001|p=186}} In mid-May, Japan started the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schoppa|2011|p=28}}.</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=lILltXBTo8oC&pg=PA19&dq=disease+caused+up+to+10,000+casualties&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FeqFVM39EdejyATb8IGACA&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=disease%20caused%20up%20to%2010%2C000%20casualties&f=false  Chevrier & Chomiczewski & Garrigue 2004], p.19.</ref> In early June, Japan put its operations into action but the Americans, having broken [[Japanese naval codes]] in late May, were fully aware of plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive [[Battle of Midway|victory at Midway]] over the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ropp|2000|p=368}}.</ref>

[[File:Marines rest in the field on Guadalcanal.jpg|right|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theatre]], 1942]]

With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] by an [[Kokoda Track campaign|overland campaign]] in the [[Territory of Papua]].{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=339}} The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern [[Solomon Islands]], primarily [[Guadalcanal]], as a first step towards capturing [[Rabaul]], the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Adrian |year=2003 |title=The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Times to the Present Day |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=1-59228-027-7 |p=259}}</ref>

Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, [[Guadalcanal Campaign|the Battle for Guadalcanal]] took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the [[Oro Province|northern part of the island]], where they faced Australian and United States troops in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]].{{sfn|Swain|2001|p=197}} Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and [[Operation Ke|withdrew their troops]].{{sfn|Hane|2001|p=340}} In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, [[First Arakan Offensive|an offensive into the Arakan region]] in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943.{{sfn|Marston|2005|p=111}} The second was the [[Operation Longcloth|insertion of irregular forces]] behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.{{sfn|Brayley|2002|p=9}}

Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=31}} In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|Kerch Peninsula]] and at [[Second Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]],{{sfn|Read|2004|p=764}} and then launched their main [[Case Blue|summer offensive]] against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the [[Baku Oil Fields|oil fields of the Caucasus]] and occupy [[Kuban]] [[steppe]], while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split [[Army Group South]] into two groups: [[Army Group A]] advanced to the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while [[Army Group B]] headed towards the [[Volga River]]. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.{{sfn|Davies|2006|loc=p. 100 (2008 ed.)}}

By mid-November, the Germans had [[Battle of Stalingrad|nearly taken Stalingrad]] in bitter [[urban warfare|street fighting]] when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an [[Operation Uranus|encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad]]{{sfn|Beevor|1998|pp=239–65}} and an assault on the [[Operation Mars|Rzhev salient near Moscow]], though the latter failed disastrously.{{sfn|Black|2003|p=119}} By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender,{{sfn|Beevor|1998|pp=383–91}} and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive.

In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|annexed portions of Czechoslovakia]]) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) by the end of the war, this figure does not include the [[Nazi plunder|sizeable plunder]] of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|1996|p=42}}.</ref> Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.<ref name="Milward 1979 138">{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=138}}.</ref>

[[File:WorldWarII-GDP-Relations-Allies-Axis-simple.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Allied to Axis GDP ratio]]

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.<ref name="6Econ3">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=3}}.</ref> In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.<ref name="6Econ3"/>

Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]].<ref name="6Econ2">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=2}}.</ref> While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the [[labour force]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Bernstein|1991|p=267}}.</ref> Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffith|first=Charles|title=The Quest: Haywood Hansell and American Strategic Bombing in World War II|isbn=1-58566-069-8|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1999|page=203}}</ref> and Germany's late shift to a [[war economy]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Overy|1994|p=26}}.</ref> contributed significantly.

Aircraft were used for [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]], as [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s, and [[close air support|ground-support]], and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included [[airlift]] (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);<ref name="EncWWII_76">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=76}}.</ref> and of [[strategic bombing]] (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).<ref>{{Harvnb|Levine|1992|p=227}}.</ref> [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft weaponry]] also advanced, including defences such as [[radar]] and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German [[88 mm gun]]. The use of the [[jet aircraft]] was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.<ref>{{Harvnb|Klavans|Di Benedetto|Prudom|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Ward|2010|pp=247–51}}.</ref>

Advances were made in nearly every aspect of [[naval warfare]], most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, [[Battle of Taranto|actions at Taranto]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.<ref name="EncWWII_163">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=163}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|last2=Chant|first2=Chris|title=Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft|page=7|publisher=Silverdale Books|year=2004|isbn=1-84509-079-9|location=Wigston, Leics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Chenoweth|first1=H.

In the Atlantic, [[escort carrier]]s proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the [[Mid-Atlantic gap]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sumner|Baker|2001|p=25}}.</ref> Carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft<ref>{{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|p=14}}.</ref> and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gardiner|Brown|2004|p=52}}.</ref> Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War,<ref name="Bur&Ryd 1995 15">{{Harvnb|Burcher|Rydill|1995|p=15}}.</ref> were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[anti-submarine weapon|weaponry]] and tactics, such as [[sonar]] and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII submarine]] and [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] tactics.<ref name="Bur&Ryd 1995 16">{{Harvnb|Burcher|Rydill|1995|p=16}}.</ref> Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the [[Leigh light]], [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]], [[Squid (weapon)|squid]], and [[Mark 24 mine|homing torpedoes]] proved victorious.

[[Land warfare]] changed from the static front lines of World War&nbsp;I to increased mobility and [[combined arms]]. The [[tank]], which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.<ref name="EncWWII_125">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=125}}.</ref> In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor Nevitt|title=The Evolution of Weapons and Warfare|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|isbn=0-7106-0123-9|year=1982|page=231}}</ref> and [[Tanks in World War II|advances continued throughout the war]] with increases in speed, armour and firepower.

At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.<ref name="EncWWII_108">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=108}}.</ref> This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.<ref name="EncWWII_125"/> Many means of [[anti-tank warfare|destroying tanks]], including [[Indirect fire|indirect artillery]], [[anti-tank gun]]s (both towed and [[self-propelled gun|self-propelled]]), [[anti-tank mine|mines]], short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were utilised.<ref name="EncWWII_108" /> Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,<ref name="EncWWII_734">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=734}}.</ref> and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War&nbsp;I.<ref name="Comp_221">{{Harvnb|Cowley|Parker|2001|p=221}}.</ref>

The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German [[MG34]], and various [[submachine gun]]s which were suited to [[close combat]] in urban and jungle settings.<ref name="Comp_221" /> The [[assault rifle]], a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infantry Weapons Of World War 2|url=http://greyfalcon.us/Infantry%20Weapons%20Of%20World%20War%202.htm|publisher=Grey Falcon (Black Sun)|accessdate=14 November 2009|quote=These all-purpose guns were developed and used by the German army in the 2nd half of World War 2 as a result of studies which showed that the ordinary rifle's long range is much longer than needed, since the soldiers almost always fired at enemies closer than half of its effective range. The assault rifle is a balanced compromise between the rifle and the sub-machine gun, having sufficient range and accuracy to be used as a rifle, combined with the rapid-rate automatic firepower of the sub machine gun. Thanks to these combined advantages, assault rifles such as the American M-16 and the Russian AK-47 are the basic weapon of the modern soldier}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The AK-47: the worlds favourite killing machine |publisher=controlarms.org |first=Oliver |last=Sprague |first2=Hugh |last2=Griffiths |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT30/011/2006/en/11079910-d422-11dd-8743-d305bea2b2c7/act300112006en.pdf |accessdate=14 November 2009 |year=2006 |format=PDF |page=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430165110/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT30/011/2006/en/11079910-d422-11dd-8743-d305bea2b2c7/act300112006en.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2011 }}</ref>

Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large [[codebook]]s for [[cryptography]] by designing [[cipher]]ing machines, the most well known being the German [[Enigma machine]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ratcliff|2006|p=11}}.</ref> Development of [[SIGINT]] (''sig''nals ''int''elligence) and [[cryptanalysis]] enabled the countering process of decryption.
