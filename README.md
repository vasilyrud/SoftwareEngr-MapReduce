# SoftwareEngr-MapReduce
MapReduce Usage and Implementation for Software Engineering 2017 Final Project

## Project's purpose 
The goal of the project is to implement a rudimentary working MapReduce system. The purpose of implementing MapReduce is to understand the algorithm in-depth as well as apply Design Patterns, Java concurrency, and software engineering testing best-practices.

MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets by splitting a particular computation between parallel clusters. The model of MapReduce has been applied by Google and others to analyze large datasets in a reasonable amount of time. Since we will be working on individual machines, we will rely on Java multy-threading to simulate the distributed clusters.
